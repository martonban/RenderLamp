# RenderLamp (WIP)
![Cover](RenderLampCover.png)

## What is RenderLamp
RenderLamp is a offline rendering engine written in C++.   

## Architecture:
- Batch Rendering System - Managing user input and the whole rendering engine owerall.
- File System - This will handle the input and output files.
- Rendering Engine(s) - The chosen rendering engine.

## Getting Started:
RenderLamp is a simple rendering engine, without any editor (in the future I want to do one but I don't have any time for that). If you start the project a cmd will pop up, over here you can chose rendering engine, and give a directory to your render batch(project if you will). After that you need to give the description file(s) to the batch. After that the rendering engine will start the batch and the output result will be placed based on the batch file. <br>
*documetation soon...(need to develop the engine first :P)*

## Avalable Rendering Engines:
In the future I want to create multiple rendering engines. Currently this project have only rendering engine. Every rendering engine will have different fuctinalites and capabilities. 

### RenderLamp - Buzz
This is the implemetation of the @ssloy's tinyrenderer. This is CPU software renderer. This rendering engine will able to load 3D models(.obj) to the scene you can put textures on it, and choose different kind of lights.  <br>
