![Cover](RenderLampCover.png)

## What RenderLamp is
RenderLamp is a 3D CPU raytracer with a simple 3D editor. With this software you can create scenes and render them with a raytracer.

## Resoures
I used CMAKE and MSVC for the whole project.<br>
The editor based on raylib, ImGUI and rlImGui <br>
The renderer is based on the Ray Tracing in One Weekend series and much more.
