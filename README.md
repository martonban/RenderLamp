# RenderLamp (WIP)
![Cover](RenderLampCover.png)

## What RenderLamp is
RenderLamp is a 3D CPU ray tracer with a simple editor. You can create scenes give properties to objects and render those scenes with a raytracer. 

## Motivation
This project is mainly a C++ project to me and not a graphics one. So please don't expect complicated rendering algorithms. In the future I want to continue this project like using CUDA/OpenCL or implementing a renderer for the editor too. 

## Resoures
I used CMAKE and MSVC for the whole project.<br>
The editor based on raylib. <br>
The whole project will use [nlohmannjson](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) libary for handling json files and GoogleTest for unit testing. <br>
The renderer is based on the Ray Tracing in One Weekend series and much more.
